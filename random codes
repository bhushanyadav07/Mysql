Sure! Here's an example of PHP Laravel code that fetches data from a database based on the date and displays it in a graph using the y-axis as months and the x-axis as the number of IDs:

First, you need to set up a database table with the necessary columns, including a `date` column and an `id` column. Let's assume the table is named `data`.

Next, create a new Laravel controller using the following command in your terminal:
```
php artisan make:controller GraphController
```

Open the newly created `GraphController.php` file and add the following code:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

class GraphController extends Controller
{
    public function showGraph()
    {
        // Fetch data from the database
        $data = DB::table('data')->get();

        // Initialize arrays for storing values
        $months = [];
        $ids = [];

        // Extract month and count ID for each record
        foreach ($data as $record) {
            $month = date('F', strtotime($record->date)); // Format month as full name (e.g., January)
            $id = $record->id;
            
            // Increment count for the corresponding month
            if (isset($months[$month])) {
                $months[$month]++;
            } else {
                $months[$month] = 1;
            }

            // Store the corresponding ID
            $ids[$month][] = $id;
        }

        // Prepare data for the graph
        $graphData = [
            'months' => array_keys($months),
            'counts' => array_values($months),
            'ids' => $ids,
        ];

        return view('graph', compact('graphData'));
    }
}
```

Next, create a new Laravel Blade view file named `graph.blade.php` in the `resources/views` directory and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Graph</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div style="width: 800px; height: 400px;">
        <canvas id="graph"></canvas>
    </div>

    <script>
        var graphData = @json($graphData);

        var ctx = document.getElementById('graph').getContext('2d');
        var graph = new Chart(ctx, {
            type: 'bar',
            data: {
                labels: graphData.months,
                datasets: [{
                    label: 'Count',
                    data: graphData.counts,
                    backgroundColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.5)',
                    borderColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                    borderWidth: 1
                }]
            },
            options: {
                scales: {
                    y: {
                        beginAtZero: true,
                        stepSize: 1
                    }
                }
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Finally, add a route to the `routes/web.php` file to map the `showGraph()` method in the `GraphController` to a URL. Open `routes/web.php` and add the following code:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\GraphController;

Route::get('/graph', [GraphController::class, 'showGraph']);
```

Now, when you navigate to the `/graph` URL in your browser, the graph will be displayed with the months on the y-axis and the count of IDs on the x-axis.

Please note that you need to have the Chart.js library included in your HTML file for the graph to display properly. In the provided code, it is included from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
