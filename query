Method 1: Using OpenSSL

Download and install OpenSSL on your Windows server.
Open a command prompt window.
Navigate to the directory where your .pem file is located.
Run the following command:
openssl rsa -in my_pem_file.pem -out my_key_file.key
Replace my_pem_file.pem with the name of your .pem file and my_key_file.key with the name of the key file that you want to create.

Enter a password for the key file when prompted.
Method 2: Using PuTTYgen

Download and install PuTTYgen on your Windows server.
Open PuTTYgen.
Click the Load button and select your .pem file.
Click the Save Private Key button and select the location where you want to save the key file.
In the Key comment field, enter a comment for the key file.
Click the Save button.
Once you have converted the .pem file to a key file, you can use the key file to authenticate with your Windows server.

Important: Be sure to store the key file in a secure location. If the key file is lost or stolen, it could allow someone else to access your Windows server.
